    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti bolognese is a dish made with 2 main ingredients: spaghetti and bolognese sauce.
        A bolognese sauce is a traditional meat-based sauce in Italian cuisine.  Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery, carrot,
        different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork.
        White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomatoes are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce a thick sauce.
        It is easy to make, healthy, and nutritious. It is a perfect dish to make for your kids, for a family reunion, or even for a day that you want to light up your mood.
