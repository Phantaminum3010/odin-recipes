    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creamy Peppercorn Sauce was always my first choice at steakhouses which I frequented quite regularly back in my corporate days.

        Having traded in suits and heels for an apron, thereâ€™s no corporate lunches for me anymore. I make my steaks at home!

        There are a handful of truly great sauces in this world that are deceptively simple to make, and this creamy pepper sauce for steak is one of them.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Season the steak generously with salt and pepper, then let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over the steak to your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove your steak from the pan to prepare for the peppercorn sauce.</li>
