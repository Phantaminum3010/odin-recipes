    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What do I need to say more about this dish? Everyone loves french fries. This is one of the childhood dishes that everyone of us used to ask moms to make every week.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium russet potatoes or 2 big russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1 can of canola oil</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Rinse them twice in cold water and pat them completely dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don’t overcrowd them by placing too many in at a time, they won’t be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</li>
    </ol>
